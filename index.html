    <h1>Ahmed Qozeem Olalekan</h1>
    <p>My name is Ahmed Qozeem Olalekan, I am 26 years old. I am from Kwara State, Ilorin. I have 7 siblings; two brothers and five sisters. 
        My parents are Mr Ahmed Omosidi and Mrs Ahmed Fatimah, they are civil servants. 
        <br><br> I attended An-Nur Islamic school for my primary education for six years and Government Day Secondary School Adewole for my scondary eduction for six years.
        I wrote my final exmaination for WAEC (West Africa Examination Council) and NECO (National Examinations Council) 2014. In 2015 I got admitted into University of Ilorin to study English and Literary studies. I went for my National Youth Service in 2019/2020 where I served in Osun state, Ila Orangun. <br><br> I love coding because I want to help people grow through technology and help businesses to develop through the use of technology.
         <br> TIIDELab has given me the avenue to start my journey as a software developer by admmitting me into their pre-fellowship program which is an oppurtunity to make it to the Fellowship to learn and re-learn as a newbie in the field of technology for 6 months. 
         <br> I hope to see myself become a trained and good software developer after this program.</p><br><br>
